# Namada Close Quarters Testnet 1

This testnet introduces the following new features:

- [on-chain governance](../user-guide/ledger/governance.md) - create and vote for proposals both onchain and offchain
- [MASP (multi-asset shielded pool) transfers](../user-guide/ledger/masp.md) - make private transfers of any Namada token

Future testnets will include more features as described in [the Namada spec](https://specs.anoma.net/master/architecture/namada.html), like IBC (inter-blockchain communication protocol), bridging to the Ethereum blockchain and more.

## Chain information

Latest values regarding the testnet that would be useful to have in your shell:
